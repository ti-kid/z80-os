# z80-os , an os for ti83+ and 84+

To build you need Brass.exe in a shell script named brass, rabbitsign, packxxu, and rompatch.

Brass you can find https://www.benryves.com/bin/brass/
Rabbitsign is on github.
And packxxu and rompatch are on ticalc win tools in ostools.Not os2tools, ostools.

Note that for the ROM making capabilities, you need a ti84plus ROM named ti84plus.rom in the main dir.  
If you would like to put a ti83plus ROM then remove the -4 flag on rompatch in the make file and change the ROM named appropriately.
